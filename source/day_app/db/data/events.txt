You have just woken up. It's 8:30 and you are 30 minutes from class! What do you do? Do you 'eat' breakfast or 'rush' to class?
*gooooooong!* Time for the morning meeting. SKIPPERS TO THE CAAVE! You listen to the morning check-in with Brick and Strand..
Go forth and code! Do you want to pair or go solo today?
It's 6:30PM. You've done some great coding today! Do you want to 'stay' to 'continue' coding?
